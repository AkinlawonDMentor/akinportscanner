Port scanner is a tool used to detect open ports and services on a networked device. It helps identify available communication endpoints and is commonly used in network security assessments, troubleshooting, and penetration testing.


Ethical Considerations:

Using a port scanner on a network without permission is illegal in many jurisdictions. Always ensure that you have proper authorization before conducting port scans.
